    <h1>Metaverse</h1>
    <p>
        In futurism and science fiction, the metaverse is a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, 
        universal and immersive virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented
        reality (AR) headsets.
    </p>

    <p><b>
        The term "metaverse" originated in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash, as a portmanteau of "meta" and "universe". 
        Access points for the metaverse includes general-purpose computers and smartphones, augmented reality, mixed reality, and virtual reality.
        Dependence on VR technology has limited metaverse development and wide-scale adoption. Limitations of portable hardware and the need to balance cost and design have caused a lack of high-quality graphics and mobility. Lightweight wireless headsets have struggled to achieve retina display pixel density needed for visual immersion. Another issue for wide-scale adoption of the technology is cost, with consumer VR headsets ranging in price from $300 to $3500 as of 2022.
        Current hardware development is focused on overcoming limitations of VR headsets, sensors, and increasing immersion with haptic technology.
    </b></p>

    <p>
        Metaverse development is often linked to advancing virtual reality technology due to increasing demands for immersion. 
        Recent interest in metaverse development is influenced by Web3, a concept for a decentralized iteration of the internet. Web3 and The Metaverse have been used as buzzwords to exaggerate development progress of various related technologies and projects for public relations purposes. Information privacy, user addiction, and user safety are concerns within the metaverse, stemming from challenges facing the social media and video game industries as a whole.
